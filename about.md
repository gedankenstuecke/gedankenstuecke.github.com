Bastian is a Senior Researcher within the [_Tools, Practices, Systems_ programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) of the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) in London, where he and his team are working on how to enable the co-creation of citizen science projects. Before this he was leading the [_Peer-Produced Research Lab_](https://research.cri-paris.org/teampage?id=5d809b499a474e063faa3a1a) at UniversitÃ© Paris CitÃ© within INSERM unit UMR1284. In a former life he was a biologist-turned-bioinformatician-turned-citizen-scientist who did a Master's degree in Ecology & Evolution and ended up doing a bioinformatics PhD on how symbiotic relationships influence genomic evolution.

Bastian is an avid fan of Open \(Source\|Access\|Science\|Culture\|.\*\) and is convinced that basically everything is better if you add *open* in front of it. He co-founded [openSNP](https://opensnp.org) â€“ a crowdsourced/*citizen* science open data project that puts personal genetics data into the public domain â€“ in 2011. He also acts as the *Director of Research* for [Open Humans](https://openhumans.org) â€“ a non-profit that provides digital and social infrastructure around personal-data driven citizen science and self-research.

In the pre-pandemic days he traveled a lot and liked it. Beyond his interest in [data driven self-improvement](/quantifiedself/) he is also interested in *Do It Yourself Biology*.
