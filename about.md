A biologist-turned-bioinformatician. Did a Master's degree in Ecology & Evolution at the Goethe University of Frankfurt and developed a taste for bioinformatics/computational biology along the way.
Thus finished a bioinformatics PhD on how symbiotic relationships influence genomic evolution.

Avid fan of Open \(Source\|Access\|Science\|Culture\|.\*\). Convinced that basically everything is better if you add *open* in front of it.
Thus co-founded [openSNP](https://opensnp.org) â€“ a crowdsourced/*citizen* science open data project that puts personal genetics data into the public domain â€“ in 2011.
For the same reason the *Director of Research* for [Open Humans](https://openhumans.org).

Traveling a lot and liking it. Interested in [data driven self-improvement](/quantifiedself/) and *Do It Yourself Biology*. Speaks Python, R & Ruby (on Rails) and even a bit of Perl.
