Bastian is a Senior Researcher within the [_Tools, Practices, Systems_ programme](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) of the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) in London, where he and his team are working on how to enable the co-creation of citizen science projects. Before this he was leading the [_Peer-Produced Research Lab_](https://peer-produced.science/) at Université Paris Cité within INSERM unit UMR1284. Overall, Bastian's research centers around how open source/science technologies can be used to empower individuals and communities to engage in their own knowledge production. He does so by bringing together applied and theoretical methods from computer/data science, human-computer-interaction and critical science & technology studies. In a former life he was a biologist-turned-bioinformatician-turned-citizen-scientist who did a Master's degree in Ecology & Evolution and ended up doing a bioinformatics PhD on how symbiotic relationships influence genomic evolution.

Bastian is an avid fan of Open \(Source\|Access\|Science\|Culture\|.\*\) and is convinced that basically everything is better if you add *open* in front of it. He co-founded [openSNP](https://opensnp.org) – a crowdsourced/*citizen* science open data project that puts personal genetics data into the public domain – in 2011 as his first citizen science effort. Since 2017, he also acts as the *Director of Research* for [Open Humans](https://openhumans.org) – a non-profit that provides digital and social infrastructure around personal-data driven citizen science and self-research.

In the pre-pandemic days he traveled a lot and liked it. Beyond his interest in [data driven self-improvement](/quantifiedself/) he is also interested in *Do It Yourself Biology*.
