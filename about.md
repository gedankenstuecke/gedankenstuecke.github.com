Currently a long-term research fellow at the [_Center for Research & Interdisciplinarity_](https://research.cri-paris.org) in Paris (UniversitÃ© de Paris, INSERM U1284) â€“ leading the [_Peer-Produced Research Lab_](https://research.cri-paris.org/teampage?id=5d809b499a474e063faa3a1a), working on how to enable the co-creation citizen science projects. In a former life a biologist-turned-bioinformatician-turned-citizen-scientist who did a Master's degree in Ecology & Evolution and ended up doing a bioinformatics PhD on how symbiotic relationships influence genomic evolution.

Avid fan of Open \(Source\|Access\|Science\|Culture\|.\*\). Convinced that basically everything is better if you add *open* in front of it.
Thus co-founded [openSNP](https://opensnp.org) â€“ a crowdsourced/*citizen* science open data project that puts personal genetics data into the public domain â€“ in 2011.
Also the *Director of Research* for [Open Humans](https://openhumans.org) â€“ working on citizen science and self-research around personal data.

Traveling a lot and liking it. Interested in [data driven self-improvement](/quantifiedself/) and *Do It Yourself Biology*. Speaks Python, R & Ruby (on Rails) and even a bit of Perl.
