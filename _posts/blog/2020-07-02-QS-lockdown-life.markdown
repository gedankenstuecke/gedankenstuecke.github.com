Yesterday I presented what I learned from all of my passive data collection as a [_Show & Tell_](https://quantifiedself.com/blog/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-the-qs-showtell/) at the first European _online_ Quantified Self meet-up. I already showed some of my insights [here on the blog](/lockdown-effects/), but I added some more data analyses for the presentation, including my movement patterns from the GPS data and details on phone usage. The presentations were recorded and I'll share them here once they are online.

As part of the preparation of the slides I also [updated my Analysis notebook](https://exploratory.openhumans.org/notebook/163/), which allows you see exactly how I did it and also enables you to run the same analysis on your data right in the _Open Humans_ Jupyter setup. The full set of data sources used are [_RescueTime_](https://ohrescuetimesource.herokuapp.com/), [_Oura Ring_](https://oura.openhumans.org/), [_Overland_](https://overland.openhumans.org) and a file upload of data export from [the _Moment_ iOS app](https://inthemoment.io/), but it will also work if you only have some of those data sources.
