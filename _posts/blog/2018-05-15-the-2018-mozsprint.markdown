Participating in the *Mozilla Global Sprint* is somewhat of an annual ritual for me. This year's installment took place on May 10/11. As *Open Humans* hadn't ever participated in a Sprint before, I spent some time in [getting up a clean list of ways to contribute on a small micro-site](http://openhumansfoundation.org/globalsprint-2018/). Given that we [recently started our *Personal Data Notebooks*](https://blog.openhumans.org/2018/05/14/personal-data-notebooks-explore-and-analyze-your-data-right-in-your-browser/), a lot of the ways to contribute focused on writing some basic data analyses notebooks.

Having a good collection of example notebooks makes for a great showcase and a fun way to teach how *Jupyter Notebooks* can be used to learn about yourself. Prior to the sprint we already had some basic example notebooks that performed simple analyses of data from *Fitbit*, *Apple Health* and *Twitter*.

During the sprint we could expand on that and get some notebooks that use data from *Moves*, *23andMe* and (soon) also *uBiome*:

- Based on a reference panel - [generated from openSNP genotype/phenotype data](https://github.com/OpenHumans/ohjh-example-notebooks/blob/master/eye-color-and-23andme-data.ipynb) - you can use your *23andMe* data to see whether your genetic data can predict your eye color.
- The GPS data of *Moves* can be used to find out [whether the weather around you influences your physical activity](https://github.com/OpenHumans/ohjh-example-notebooks/blob/master/moves-analysis.ipynb).
- Your own microbiome as analyzed by *uBiome* can soon be [compared to all public microbiome data sets](https://github.com/OpenHumans/ohjh-example-notebooks/pull/10).

But things often only get really interesting when you cross data streams. Two further notebooks that were contributed during the *#mozsprint* demonstrate this:
- One notebook correlates your *Moves* data with your *Twitter* data to see [whether the weather has an impact on your mood as recorded by your tweets](https://github.com/OpenHumans/ohjh-example-notebooks/blob/master/twitter-under-the-weather.ipynb).
- Another notebook correlates your *Twitter* posting frequency with your step counts as measured by *Fitbit* [to see whether social media makes you walk less](https://github.com/OpenHumans/ohjh-example-notebooks/blob/master/twitter-and-fitbit-activity.ipynb).

These example notebooks [are already preloaded when you start your own *Personal Data Notebooks*](http://openhumansfoundation.org/ohjh-example-notebooks) and they should work right away on your own data. They hopefully inspire you to write your own data analyses that you want to share. As a further small incentive: [*Open Humans* is running a Notebook competition until the 27th of May](https://blog.openhumans.org/2018/05/14/personal-data-notebooks-explore-and-analyze-your-data-right-in-your-browser/). The best notebooks will not only be included in our example demo notebook collection, but also highlighted on [*QuantifiedSelf.com*](http://quantifiedself.com/).

Happy data analysis everyone! üéâ üìä
