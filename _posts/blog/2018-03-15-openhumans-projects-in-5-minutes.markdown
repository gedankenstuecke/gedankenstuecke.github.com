*Open Humans* lives through its community of members and the projects they design. That's why there's a large number of tools that make the creation of these projects possible: Projects can be run [right on-site](https://www.openhumans.org/direct-sharing/on-site-features/), use the [Python command line interface library](https://github.com/OpenHumans/open-humans-api) or feature the generic [OAuth-based API-methods](https://www.openhumans.org/direct-sharing/oauth2-features/) to interact with *Open Humans*. But one thing remained somewhat of a pain: Having a way to enable *Open Humans* members to upload file(s) into your own project needed some fiddling in setting up your own website, which can be time-consuming and often is something you don't want to spend a lot of time on.

But along with [Mad](https://www.twitter.com/madprime) â€“ and the great help of some of our prospective Outreachy interns â€“ I've been busy to reduce this pain: [Meet the `oh_data_uploader`](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/oh_data_uploader) template. This ready-to-deploy project brings all you need to allow *Open Humans* members to upload data into your project. It's designed to allow for a *one-click* deployment to *heroku* (which allows you to run the whole thing for free) and all of the project configuration can be done right in your browser, no assembly or coding required.

Now the process boils down to [a simple 5-step guide](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/oh_data_uploader/blob/master/README.md) and instead of taking some hours to set up your own data source it should now take between 5-10 minutes. Just use the administrative backend to fill out the configuration parameters, add the file meta data you expect and edit the copy-text of your project website using Markdown in the same way and you're good to go. You can [click here to see how it looks like out of the box](https://ohuploadertemplatetest.herokuapp.com/) (just ask if you want to have the demo password ðŸ˜Š).

I made already good use of this template myself, because it is what I used to [quickly deploy the *FamilyTreeDNA* integration](https://familytreedna-upload.herokuapp.com/) into *Open Humans*. What so far missing, new data source will you add to *Open Humans* today?
