_As if the sand were made of stone_ is an ongoing documentary photography project that we (that is [Eugenia](https://www.ecovernton.info/) and I) are working on. The project covers how small villages & hamlets across rural Argentina – in particular the Argentinean Pampa – are changing and adapting in response to transport shifting from rail to road. 

The project brings together traditional analog media (i.e. black-and-white film photography and wet printing) and the digital (i.e. [through the project website](https://asifthesand.photos/) & [data visualisations](https://tzovar.as/rayshading-argentina/)). Beyond being distributed in zine form, the images made as part of this work are also [openly licensed and available on Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/gedankenstuecke/albums/72177720315528303).
