US Senator Kamala Harris held the launch rally of her campaign for US Presidential election in Oakland on Sunday, January 27th in Downtown Oakland. A crowd of [around 20,000 people showed up](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/27/us/politics/kamala-harris-rally-2020.html), filling the streets around city hall at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza.

People (and animals) of all ages spent hours in line, waiting to gain entrance to the plaza itself, blocking off a whole city block in a snaking queue.
