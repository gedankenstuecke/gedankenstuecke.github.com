The [_Wassail_ or _orchard-visiting wassail_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassailing) is an English tradition in which people visit their local orchards to bless their fruit trees to ensure a good harvest come autumn. Typically, these celebrations are accompanied by song and dance, including [Morris dancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_dance).

In mid-January, a Wassail was held in the _East Greenwich Pleasaunce_, a small park that used to be a local graveyard for sailors from the Naval Hospital. A few years ago, the community planted different fruit trees in the park. As part of the ceremony the trees are blessed both by spreading some cider/apple juice into the trees, but also by placing pieces of bread or toast onto the branches of the trees.
