[Eugenia](https://www.ecovernton.info/) and I made our first zine, **[available here](https://ko-fi.com/s/e7f813d3e6)**, for our ongoing documentary photography project _as if the sand were stone_. The project focuses on how small villages & hamlets across the Argentinean Pampa are adapting in response to a shift in urbanism and transport – from rail to road.

For our first zine, we selected 24 images, all made on black & white film and also [created a small website for the project](https://asifthesand.photos/). On that page you can also find more background on the project, where those villages are etc. 

The full album of images [is on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/gedankenstuecke/albums/72177720315528303/).
