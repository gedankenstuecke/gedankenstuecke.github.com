Santa Con: What [started out as anti-capitalist performance art in San Francisco (hanging Santa included)](https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/an-oral-history-of-santacon), has [turned into a 'reviled bar crawl'](https://web.archive.org/web/20141212222348/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2014/12/people-hate-santacon.php), across the US.

So also in San Francisco in 2018, where hordes of Santas took over Union Square. And it wouldn't be San Francisco if a group of naked Santa was missing.
