In October 2022, [Eugenia](https://twitter.com/eugecovernton) and I spent a few weeks in Laos both in Vientiane and Luang Prabang. While we mainly went as Eugenia had to give some workshops, we also gave some school lectures through [Lecturers Without Borders](https://www.lewibo.org/) in Vientiane. But by chance we scheduled our trip to Luang Prabang to also coincide with the Boun Ok Phansa celebrations – the end of the three-month Vassa observed by Theravada practitioners, often also named "Buddhist Lent" in English.

Due to the COVID pandemic, 2022 was the first time in 3 years that the traditional celebrations could happen. Most temples and houses in the city are decorated with colorful lanterns and candles.

As part of the Boun Ok Phasa celebrations, large floats – illuminated by candles – are built which move in a parade through the town center of Luang Prabang, in front of the former royal palace and many of the adjacent temples. Besides the floats, schools and other groups walk with lanterns or perform music and dances.
