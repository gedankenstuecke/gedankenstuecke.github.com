In April 2023, I went to Argentina with the main reason being attending the [7th CSVconf in Buenos Aires](https://www.csvconf.com/). But of course we also went to visit [Eugenia's](https://twitter.com/eugecovernton) family over Easter. And we also managed to squeeze in some [Lecturers Without Borders](https://www.lewibo.org/) while there, even one in German for myself!

Between all of these things we also found some time off for sightseeing. So we headed up north to the [Iberá Provincial Natural Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iber%C3%A1_Provincial_Reserve) to look at the quite unique ecosystem there (and to finally see some Capybaras)!
