Cormac McCarthy's 1985 Western *Blood Meridian* is set at the border between Mexico and the United States in the 1830s. At around the same time we have the real-world Charles Darwin traveling the Americas on board of the *HMS Beagle*, his notebooks later published as *The Voyage of the Beagle*. Both books are very interesting travel diaries in their own way. But what would come out if you merge them into a single, somewhat random text?

*The Blood Voyage* is a very simplistic Markov chain, exploring this mashup one entry at a time. You can find the Voyage on [Tumblr](http://thebloodvoyage.tumblr.com/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheBloodVoyage), with short posts coming up maybe every 2 hours. If you're interested in the code, it's [on GitHub as well](https://github.com/gedankenstuecke/BloodVoyage). test
